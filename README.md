###OVERVIEW OF THE TASK 1

###TASK 1: SIMPLE CALCULATOR

###Objective
The objective is to create a basic Python program that functions as a calculator. It should allow users to input two numbers, select a mathematical operation, and display the result of the operation

###Key Activity
Input Handling: Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Operation Selection: Provide the user with options to choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Calculation: Perform the chosen operation based on the userâ€™s input.
Output Display: Display the result of the calculation in a clear and user-friendly format.
Error Handling: Ensure the program gracefully handles errors

###Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
                      Chosen for its simplicity, readability, and robust standard library.
Built-in Functions: input(),print().
Control Structures: if-elif-else for operation selection and validation.

###Key insights
User Experience: A clear menu for operation selection and error messages enhances usability.
                 Prompting for re-entry of invalid inputs improves user interaction.
Error Handling: Anticipating common issues like division by zero or invalid inputs ensures reliability.
Scalability: The program can be extended to include additional mathematical operations or features (e.g., power, square root).
Educational Value: This task serves as a practical introduction to input validation, conditional logic
